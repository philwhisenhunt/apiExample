<?php

//Requirements: 
/*
Make an API

Going to need a GET and POST route

The POST route needs to:
accept JSON
    should end up containing a persons first name and last name.

If they post something that is not first name [or last name], respond with a 400 error.

Otherwise store the name in a csv file. 

The get request should return the names in the CSV
    if there is no name or no CSV, return a 404 error.

    error needs to say why it failed, say what was missing, in JSON.
